/*************************************************************************************/

This is an alpha version of Froppy chess software. The program is meant to be a 
Human vs AI chess game, with the AI being trained with a neural network. The foundations
for the neural net have been created, but the main chess gameplay is still in progress. 


*The foundation code is close to being completed, 
so a main program integrating all of it has not been compiled yet. However, the individual
target files are compilable separately.

Check the source directory for source code and test files.
Refer to Chess_SoftwareSpec.pdf in doc/ directory for more detailed instructions.
