/*****************************************************************************/

This is an alpha version of Froppy chess software. The program is meant to be a 
Human vs AI chess game, with the AI being trained with a neural network. The foundations
for the neural net have been created, but the main chess gameplay is still in progress. 


*There is no user executable at the moment. The foundation code is close to being completed, 
so a main program integrating all of it has not been compiled yet.

Refer to Chess_UserManual.pdf in doc/ directory for more detailed instructions.
